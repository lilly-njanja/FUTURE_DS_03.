ðŸ“Š Student Feedback Analysis Report
1. Introduction

This project analyzed feedback data collected from students to evaluate teaching quality, course delivery, and overall satisfaction. The dataset contained 1001 responses with numeric ratings on key teaching indicators, alongside a recommendation score used to classify satisfaction levels.

2. Methodology

Data cleaning: Removed unnecessary columns, renamed variables for clarity.

Indicators analyzed:

Subject knowledge

Concept clarity

Use of presentations

Assignment difficulty

Doubt solving

Course structure

Student support

Satisfaction classification:

High (recommendation â‰¥ 7)

Medium (recommendation 4â€“6)

Low (recommendation â‰¤ 3)

Analysis methods: Descriptive statistics, pie chart, histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap, and overall score distribution.

3. Key Findings

Strong subject knowledge: Teachers score highest in subject knowledge (average â‰ˆ 7.5), indicating confidence in mastery of content.

Moderate clarity and presentations: Concept clarity (â‰ˆ 6.1) and presentations (â‰ˆ 5.9) are satisfactory but leave room for improvement.

Weak areas:

Course structure (â‰ˆ 5.6)

Assignment difficulty (â‰ˆ 5.4)
These areas scored lowest and are likely linked to dissatisfaction among some students.

Satisfaction distribution: The majority of students are in the High group, but a notable share fall into Medium and Low categories.

Correlations: Subject knowledge and concept clarity have the strongest positive relationship with recommendation scores, showing they are the main drivers of satisfaction.

4. Recommendations

Redesign assignments

Ensure difficulty levels are balanced and align with taught material.

Break down large tasks into smaller, structured parts.

Improve course structure

Provide a clear roadmap (modules, weekly goals, and learning outcomes).

Incorporate interactive or visual teaching aids to boost engagement.

Enhance student support

Offer regular doubt-clearing sessions and office hours.

Encourage peer discussions or study groups.

Continuous feedback loop

Conduct a short mid-semester survey to track improvements.

Compare future feedback against this baseline for evidence of progress.

5. Conclusion

The analysis shows that students value teachersâ€™ subject knowledge and clear explanations most. However, course structure, assignment design, and student support require focused improvements. By strengthening these areas, overall satisfaction and recommendation rates are likely to rise significantly.
